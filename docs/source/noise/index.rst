Noise
=====

In order to have a realistic challenge with entity resolution, it is essential
to add noise to the simulated data. "Noise" refers to various types of errors
introduced into the data and may also be called "corruption" or "distortion." By
default, pseudopeople applies noise to the simulated datasets using some
reasonable settings. If desired, the user can change the noise settings through
the configuration system---see the :ref:`Configuration section <configuration_main>`
for details.

.. _categories_of_noise:

Categories of noise
-------------------

pseudopeople can add two broad categories of noise to the datasets it generates:

#. **Row-based noise:** Errors in the inclusion or exclusion of entire rows of
   data, such as duplication or omission
#. **Column-based noise:** Errors in data entry for an individual field within a
   row, such as miswriting or incorrectly selecting responses

Each type of row-based noise operates on the entire dataset (selecting rows to
include or exclude), while each type of column-based noise operates on one
column of data at a time (selecting cells within that column to noise).
Currently, errors added in different columns are independent of each other.

.. _available_noise_types:

Available noise types
---------------------

These tables list all the available noise types, but not every
type of noise will necessarily be applied to every dataset or every column.
Noise types are applied in the order they are listed here.
The "Config key" column shows the name of the noise type in the :ref:`configuration system <configuration_main>`.

      In the SSA dataset, the SSN column has no column-based noise by default (but can be configured to have noise if desired).
      In the 1040 form, the same noise types apply to the SSN columns for the joint filer and dependents.
